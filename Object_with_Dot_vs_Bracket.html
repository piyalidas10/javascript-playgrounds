Most of us have learned that we can access the property of an Object using either dot or bracket notation and both are the same.

This is true in most cases, but there are some edge cases in which these two differ.

It's only when we make a mistake, we realize the difference...𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕'𝒔 𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕.

I am sharing the learning from my mistake:

If you try to access the property value by providing the property name as a variable in the dot notation, you will get undefined, which is not the case with bracket notation.

Its because of the way it is processed. While with dot notation it will continue fetching from left to right. 
So first it will look for name then inside that next thing specified after dot i.e. printname property and so on if more is there.

But with bracket notation before directly looking for that property, it will first evaluate that bracket part and then fetch it. 
So that's why we can give variables and even expressions in bracket notation.

<script>
    let name = {
        'firstname': 'Piyali',
        'lastname': 'Das'
    };
    let printname = 'firstname';

    console.log(name.printname);
    console.log(name[printname]);
</script>
